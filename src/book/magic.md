# Magic

An explanation of the cosmology of this setting and how magic operates.

How does magic work? How does religion work? How do they make class powers work?

  - Ki energy sources
  - manipulating Ki

Overview of class concepts and ways different classes manipulate Ki:

## Martial

  - Fighter   : martial training
  - Rogue     : stealthy skills / expertise
  
## Arcane

  - Bard      : study as part of a bardic company
  - Druid     : study ancient rituals in a druid circle
  - Wizard    : study at wizard library or tower
  
## Divine

power from abstract moral ideas that exist in the universe. 

  - Cleric    : power from a domain
  - Paladin   : power from an oath
  - Ranger    : power from ideals of nature / balance
  
## Primal

use willpower to manipulate the body's own Ki

  - Barbarian : using innate anger to fuel power
  - Monk      : monastic training focuses on manipulating the body's Ki
  - Sorcerer  : innate power to manipulate Ki
  
  
# Rules

Vancian magic sucks. Instead use some sort of spell-points based system. 

When you do spellcasting as some sort of class power (like arcane trickster or eldritch knight) you have to decide how that's gonna work. Is it like a wizard-study type of thing, or a sorcerer sudden magic type of thing? 

## Arcane

For Wizards, they gain spells when they research them. Finding Ruinc scrolls, books, or doing library and lab research. Bards work the same way but they're experimenting with sounds and learning Runic songs. Druids learn all their stuff from the ancient rituals. They learn from old masters and discover new things the same way. 

## Divine

Divine magic works based on abstract ideas. Maybe by practicing philosophical ideas? Studying notes gives you spell points? 

## Primal

Willpower based magic is already taken care of in these classes. It's a daily thing. 

For Sorcerors, they learn new stuff by chance every time they use magic in a stressful situation. Maybe on a crit they do a random weird spell. Using spells takes some sort of spell points.
