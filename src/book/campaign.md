# Campaign

This is a campaign for all the players. 

## Trial Adventure

First adventure will be [Gnoll Attack on Bryder](gnoll-attack). I will bring 2nd level pre-gen characters for people to play but I guess they can make a character themselves if they want to. 

This is just a one-shot to figure out if DMing is a worthwhile thing for me to do. 

## Campaign Start

The campaign will start with players all making 1st-level characters. Then the players will begin with the hook adventure [The Broken Tower](broken-tower). 

Afterwards they will be given the map of the region they are in and adventure hooks that tie into their backstories.
