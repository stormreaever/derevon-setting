# Adventures

- Module 1: [The Broken Tower](broken-tower) (level 1)

  A watch tower kept the village safe from bandits, but it's been sacked and taken over by goblins. Now they're attacked by bandits all the time. If the party wants to solve this problem, they need to take back the tower and allow the villagers to rebuild it. 

- Module 2: [Gnoll Attack on Bryder](gnoll-attack) (level 2)

  A hunter encountered and killed a gnoll during the hunt. In order to prevent attacks on the village and surrounding farms, the party must track the rest of the gnolls to their den and eliminate the pack. 
  
- Module 3: The Orc-Infested Monastery

  A monastery in the forest used to be a wilderness outpost, but it was taken over by orcs years ago. In an effort to spread his domain and take back the wilderness, the Baron sees the monastery as a key strategic point and asks the party to take it back for him. 
  
  The monastery main levels are overrun with Orcs... but even the Orcs know not to investigate the incessant thumping noises in the basement. One the party has cleared the top level, they have the opportunity to open up the cellar and take on the ghouls below.
