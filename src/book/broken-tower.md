# Module 1: The Broken Tower

A watch tower kept the village safe from bandits, but it's been sacked and taken over by goblins. Now they're attacked by bandits all the time. If the party wants to solve this problem, they need to take back the tower and allow the villagers to rebuild it. 

## The Hook

Players begin their adventure in the village of Huntington. One of them 


Give one (charismatic leader) player a merchant friend who wants to meet for drinks. At the meeting, the merchant describes his trouble with caravans getting attacked on the road. The merchant offers a reward for the player to investigate the problem: 50 gp if the PC can solve the problem, and since he needs to hire help, he can offer 50 gp to each of them as well. 

Ideally the leader will know a couple of the other players and ask them to help with the problem. One of them knows that the watch tower has been out of commission for a couple of months. 

In the next couple of days, several caravans are attacked on the road near the tower.
