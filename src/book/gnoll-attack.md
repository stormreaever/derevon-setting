# Module 2: Gnoll Attack on Bryder

## Setting

### The Village of Bryder

The PCs are residents of a small village called Bryder. One or two (of the more exotic races) might be travelers passing through. 

Bryder has woods to the south and is supported by the surrounding farmland (mostly to the east and north). Nearby landmarks include:
  - main road through the village going east and west
  - hunting cabin in the woods
  - a peak in the woods with waterfall (water running east) and nice view of the village and surrounding woods
  - pond shrine at the edge of the woods where people pray to nature spirits

Bryder's government is a direct democracy. Every week the village has a communal meeting where residents are free to bring up issues. The Alderman  will present options on what to do and tally the votes.

#### NPCs

- The Alderman (M)
- The Hunter (M)
  - has a pet Blink Dog (MM 318) that he brings along on the hunt.
- The Carpenter (F)
- The Blacksmith (M)
- Village Elder (F)

#### The Gnolls

A pack of gnolls roams the forest preying on deer, rabbits, and farm stock. Now that they've been alerted of a nearby village they want to terrorize it raid it for human slaves for their demon lord. Gnolls worship brutality and fight not only to defend their territory, but also to inflict pain on their enemies.

## Adventure

### The Aldermeeting

#### Small Claims Court

Our adventure begins at this week's Aldermeeting. The first order of business is a small dispute between a carpenter and a blacksmith. The carpenter alleges that she was sold a faulty hand drill, which she shows. The drill bit cannot fit into the hand crank. If someone (maybe a PC, maybe an NPC) spots the flaw (a dent in the crank makes the attachment impossible) the blacksmith admits that his son made it and he did not check the quality before delivering it. 

The Alderman takes a survey of what people want the result to be. Someone suggests that the blacksmith pay the carpenter twice what the drill is worth and gives him a new one. The assembled crowd mostly agrees. If a PC speaks up and makes an alternate suggestion, and it's reasonable, they will be in a CHA (Persuasion) contest with the villager. The vote is taken and the winner has their result announced by the Alderman.

#### The Hunter & Hyena Head

Before the Alderman can advance as planned, a hunter bursts through the crowd into the village center, carrying what looks like a hyena head. The hunter informs everyone that it's the head of a Gnoll -- he encountered it while he was out with his hunting party and they only barely managed to kill it. One of the party is badly injured. 

The hunter fears there are more gnolls around, since he knows they live in packs. A farmer speaks up from the crowd and says that she fear for the safety of her livestock. The hunter says she should be more afraid for herself; gnolls are vicious killers. 

#### Call to Heroics

The hunter says they should find the gnoll den and wipe them out -- he will lead a party out to the woods where the hunters encountered it. The Alderman asks who will volunteer for the mission.

If the party seems reluctant to help out, a teen girl (name of Stabler) will volunteer and hopefully spark their sense of duty. If they still don't volunteer, the Hunter will scoff and insult the honor of the residents of Bryder. 

The PCs are free to ask the hunter for details and villagers for supplies as they head out. The smith offers his finest sword (a *masterwork shortsword*) to the PCs. An elder tells them of encounters she had with gnolls long ago, and offers a protective *amulet*. She mentions that gnolls are noctural. The hunter warns of other dangers in the forest and those who are village residents share their knowledge of the surrounding area (written in their hand-out notes with the character).

### The Woods

#### Nature Shrine

Any village residents would know of the nature shrine at the edge of the woods, and the hunter insists that the group prays there before entering the forest. Anyone who succeeds on a WIS (Religion) check with a DC of 15 and advantage if they're a resident of the village gets the effect of a Guidance spell for 24 hours. (you may decide add 1d4 to any one roll in that period.)

#### Roaming Monsters

The hunter leads the party through the woods to the place where he killed the gnoll. On the way, PCs encounter some roaming monsters from [Table 1](#roaming-monsters-table-1-). When the encounter is over, the hunter leads them to...

#### The Gnoll's Body

This is the clearing where the hunter killed the gnoll. Its dead body lays on the ground. It has some arrows (from the hunting party) sticking out of it and some wolfy bite marks. Its own bow is lying close to the body. 

The Hunter points out the gnoll's trail into the woods and leaves the party there. He tells them explicity that their goal is to find the gnoll den and eliminate the gnolls. Then he gives them something he was holding back: some healing potions. 

If the PCs follow the gnoll's trail they will shortly find the entrance to the gnoll den.

### The Dungeon

#### Gnoll Den

Gnoll dens are a network of tunnels that open into larger communal areas. Tunnels are round and narrow, and some are so narrow that only a young gnoll or hyena can fit through. There are multiple entrances to the den from the outside. 

Gnolls raise and keep hyenas in their den. They sleep in different areas. Gnolls and hyenas are nocturnal and have darkvision so the den has no light source.

![Map of Gnoll Den](img/adv-1-gnoll-den-map.png)
    
##### Entrance

The entrance is a hole that's been dug under rock. Broken bones are scattered in the clearing in front of it. The entrance appears to be unguarded. 

A patrol (1 gnoll, 1&nbsp;hyena) makes the rounds of all the entrances and exits of the den every 2 hours.

If the PCs wait at the entrance for 2 hours, they will spot the guard making his rounds. Otherwise the gnoll guard (& hyena friend) will come into the den mid-encounter and surprise them from behind. 

##### Guard Room (1)

A small room for the guard to recharge. 

It contains:
- a finely crafted dagger (masterwork, +1)
- a broken shield
- 2d6 broken arrows
- a scrap of an emblazoned blue banner (INT check reveals it's from the neighbouring Barony of Arramon; this is obvious to the traveler from Arramon)
- a crude set of dice
- a pile of blood-soaked rags

##### Hallway

All hallways are curved and have a slight downward slope. The walls are round and have crevices filled with broken bone fragments. 

##### Main hall

Large open room. Stepped on both sides. -____- like that

1 hyena is sleeping up top. 2 gnolls lounge in the room. When they spot PCs, they attack. 

It contains:
- remains of wild boar
- sharp sticks
- a rusted short sword
- a small pile of shiny treasure
  - 40 copper pieces
  - 120 silver pieces
  - a chain shirt
  - a pair of gauntlets, with hands still inside

##### Waste alcove

Alcove for the hyenas to poop. 

It contains:
- poop

##### Hyena den

4-6 hyenas are sleeping (they are nocturnal). They will not attack unless provoked. If provoked, they will make a lot of noise. 

Contains:
- skeletons of prey
- a lot of fur

##### Guard Room (2)

Small room with standing guard stuff. 

It contains:
- a pile of rags
- fancy bracers
- a scrap of soft blue cloth
- empty arrow quiver
- a diamond

##### Gnoll living (1)

3 sleeping gnolls (who might have been woken up by prior noise).

Contains:
- piles of rags
- crude dice
- 30 copper pieces
- 7 gold pieces

One of the gnolls has a shield and is wearing a signet ring on a strap of leather around his neck. The ring has the coat of arms of the Barony of Arramon, which is obvious to the traveler from Arramon and the Bryder locals. 

##### Trap Room

There's a pile of rocks against a wall and the floor is marked with a subtle magic circle. If anyone steps into the circle, rocks will be disturbed and  fall, dealing 2d6 damage to all in their path (half damage on DC 15 dex save).

##### Demon Shrine

An evil-looking altar.

A religion DC 15 success will discover that it's an altar for sacrifice to the demon lord Yeenoghu. Herbs and stuff are all around, and markings in blood on the walls. Scrolls of dark magic. 

##### Gnoll Living (2)

The boss fight! This room has 2 gnolls, the gnoll cultist, and 2 hyenas. They attack when the PCs enter.

If the gnolls are in danger the hyenas will flee towards the closest entrance. 

The room contains:
- ivory small bracelet
- elaborate quilt
- 6 bottles of wine from the Barony of Arramon
- a silver flute
- a Belt of Quickness (+1 dex, +10 ft to speed)
- a magic longbow (+1)
- a pile of coins and gems
  - 70 copper pieces
  - 12 silver pieces
  - 38 gold pieces
  - 3 rubies
  
##### Guard Room(3)

The first one was the room one; if PCs exit through another guard room,

It contains:
- a pile of rags
- sticks
- rabbit fur
- broken comb
- signet ring from Barony of Arramon

##### Back to Town

On the way back to town, the players have the chance of encountering some more monsters from [Table 1](#roaming-monsters-table-1-). Roll a d6; on a 6, there is an encounter so you should roll on the table for the monsters. 

Regardless, they make it back to town in a few hours, where they can tell of their adventure.

If they show the signet ring or banner to knowledgeable people in town, they will know that the coat of arms belongs to the Barony of Arramon. What are nobles from the neighbouring barony doing out here? We leave that mystery for another time.
