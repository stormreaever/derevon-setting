# Rules

## Additional rules for things

### Shield Rule

While using a shield, any time you take damage, you can use your reaction to say your shield absorbed the force of the blow. The shield is shattered and must be discarded, but you don't take any damage from that hit. 

### Inventory

Each thing that you have equipped belongs in one of these slots. 

- Head
- Neck
- Back
- Torso
- Overcoat
- Belt
- Arms
- Hands (2 slots)
- Rings (4 slots)
- Feet

Some items, like backpacks and belts, add slots. Some are for specific things.

#### Belt: 

slots for 12 belt things, including: 

- potions
- scrolls
- sheathed weapons
- water skin
- coin pouch

#### Backpack: 

- all your other stuff can go in here, as long as it's smaller than the size of the backpack
