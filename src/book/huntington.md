### Road bandits

A merchant's caravans keep getting ransacked on the road. The merchant contacts an old acquaintance, a former bodyguard, to deal with the problem. She offers 50 gp to him and anyone else he contracts with to catch the bandits. *Additional info: there's another caravan going out in a few days. If the bodyguard can hire a team to guard it on its journey (and take care of the problem) he will be paid handsomely. The merchant stresses that if the team can find the location of the bandits, the margrave's law will take care of the rest.*

The bodyguard needs some cash to finance his important quest. When the merchant offers him 50 gp for the job, he accepts. He knows he might need some help bringing the bandits to justice so he contacts some people he knows can be of service. 

The caravan leaves at dawn. It travels south to meet the Mark's Road on its way to Kullayev. They stop to make camp just before their path meets the road. It's here where they are attacked by bandits, in the dead of night. 

There are a few bandits (the same number as player) and they also have 2 dogs. The bandits will not fight to the death -- as soon as they realize that they're on the losing side of a battle, they will retreat back to their hideout. The team can easily track them there. Or, if they have captured a bandit, interrogate him until he gives up the location. 

In order to get to the hideout the team must cross a bridge over a gorge and climb up some stuff. It gives them a great view of the road while also being obscured by foliage. The camp surrounds the mouth of a cave. If a bandit made it back here, the camp will know they're coming and all go inside. Otherwise, some people will be lounging around the fire. There are also horses and stuff walking around. And tents. 

The bandit camp consists of several family groups, with one guy in charge. It's about 15 people total. They live in these caves off the spoils of stuff they can bandit from honest people on the road. 

If the party negotiates, the bandit leader will agree to stop banditing this particular merchant's stuff. The team can also threaten to call the margrave, throw them all in jail, or execute them. The merchant said to alert the authorities, but he isn't bothered either way. If the team leaves them alive, the bandits will be gone if they come back here. Otherwise they will leave their corpses behind, won't they? For something much bigger to eat.
