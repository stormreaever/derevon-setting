## About the Campaign

### Setting

This campaign takes place in a land called [Derevon](img/map-anatellus.pdf). You start in Huntington, a small town on the borderlands of the kingdon of Leonia. Leonia is the homeland of a great emperor who united the lands under one banner. But that was 1000 years ago -- hundreds of years ago, the empire was broken into several disparate kingdoms that are now separated by dense forest and orc territory. But various leaders are trying to revive past empires through various methods. You might get caught up in them, or you might have goals of your own.

Each character you create should have a reason for being in Huntington and a pre-existing relationship with at least one other PC.

### Play Style

Feel free to do whatever you want. You'll get a map and the freedom to pursue your own goals, and there are others in the world who want to pursue *their* own goals.


## Character Creation

1. Create a character concept

2. Choose a race & class

3. Determine ability scores

4. Detail your background

5. Buy equipment

### Create a character concept

Decide who your character will be. Let your concept guide you through the next steps.

### Choose a race & class

Legal races, in order of abundance:

- __Human :__ the dominant race in Anatellus. Humans are ambitious explorers, traders, and conquerors.

- __Half-elf :__ the descendants of human mothers and elf fathers. Most half-elves live among humans, and may be far removed from their elvish heritage.

- __Elf :__ elves traveled to Anatellus from Talahaka. They live in nomadic communities or alone, wandering with little respect for human boundaries.

- __Dwarf :__ the dwarf homeland is in the Koduma mountains, but many dwarves have migrated to Periagata and throughout Anatellus in search of treasure and glory.

- __Halfling :__ their homeland is in the south. Halfkings live peacefully among humans and are known for their entertainment and fine crafts.

- __Goliath :__ goliath tribes originate in the mountains of Cīla Bhīra. They have been part of human empires and can be found living in western Anatellus. 

- __Dragonborn :__ dragonborn are known through Anatellus as self-sufficient warriors. They are often solitary, interacting with human civilization as mercenaries and soldiers. Dragonborn never seem to be happy in human society. 

- __Tiefling :__ Tieflings are half-fiends born of a human mother and incubus father. They live among humans, persecuted for their fiendish parentage. 

- __Gnome :__ gnomes exist as well. :/

### Determine ability scores

Use the standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) then apply racial bonuses.

### Detail your background

Who is your character?

Backgrounds:

- Acolyte
- Charlatan
- Criminal
- Entertainer
- Folk Hero
- Guild Artisan
- Hermit
- Noble
- Outlander
- Sage
- Sailor
- Soldier
- Urchin

Pick a background. Using it as inspiration, decide who your character was before they learned the skills of their class. If your vision differs slightly from the background as described, you may swap out some features for comparable ones.

Decide on your personality traits, bonds and flaws, using your background as inspiration. Note that these can change over the course of the game.

Alignment is based one the law-chaos / good-evil axes, but defined differently. Law and chaos represents how you think society should operate. Should there be a hierarchy of leadership that underpins society? Or should everyone fend for themselves? Good and evil are not defined morally but more of a scale of selfishness. Do you only care about yourself? Or do you care about every living thing in the world? Everyone falls somewhere in the middle, so determine the circle that you care about. Maybe your village, your friends and family, or the knights of your order. Maybe it's a combination of things. Remember that this can always change as you gain new friends (and enemies).

Decide on the moral ideal that exemplifies your character's worldview. A statement that describes your character's moral foundation.

Write a short backstory describing how your character grew up (according to their background), learned the skills of their class, and why they are in Dalbrig (the campaign's starting location). Also describe a long-term goal your character is working towards.
