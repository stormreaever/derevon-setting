<h3 id="setting">Setting</h3>
<p>The PCs are residents of a small village called Bryder. One or two (of the more exotic races) might be travelers passing through. </p>
<p>Bryder has woods to the south and is supported by the surrounding farmland (mostly to the east and north). Nearby landmarks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>hunting cabin in the woods</li>
<li>a peak in the woods with waterfall (water running east) and nice view of the village and surrounding woods</li>
<li>main road through the village going east and west</li>
<li>pond shrine at the edge of the woods where people pray to nature spirits</li>
</ul>
<p>Bryder&#39;s government is a direct democracy. Every week the village has a communal meeting where residents are free to bring up issues. The Alderman  will present options on what to do and tally the votes.</p>

<h4 id="the-gnolls">The Gnolls</h4>
<p>A pack of gnolls roams the forest preying on deer, rabbits, and farm stock.

Gnolls worship brutality and fight not only to defend their territory, but also to inflict pain on their enemies. </p>

<h3 id="the-aldermeeting">The Aldermeeting</h3>
<h4 id="small-claims-court">Small Claims Court</h4>
<p>Our adventure begins at this week&#39;s Aldermeeting. The first order of business is a small dispute between a carpenter and a blacksmith. The carpenter alleges that she was sold a faulty hand drill, which she shows. The drill bit cannot fit into the hand crank. If someone (maybe a PC, maybe an NPC) spots the flaw (a dent in the crank makes the attachment impossible) the blacksmith admits that his son made it and he did not check the quality before delivering it. </p>
<p>The Alderman takes a survey of what people want the result to be. Someone suggests that the blacksmith pay the carpenter twice what the drill is worth and gives him a new one. The assembled crowd mostly agrees. If a PC speaks up and makes an alternate suggestion, and it&#39;s reasonable, they will be in a CHA (Persuasion) contest with the villager. The vote is taken and the winner has their result announced by the Alderman.</p>
<h4 id="the-hunter-hyena-head">The Hunter &amp; Hyena Head</h4>
<p>Before the Alderman can advance as planned, a hunter bursts through the crowd into the village center, carrying what looks like a hyena head. The hunter informs everyone that it&#39;s the head of a Gnoll -- he encountered it while he was out with his hunting party and they only barely managed to kill it. One of the party is badly injured. </p>
<p>The hunter fears there are more gnolls around, since he knows they live in packs. A farmer speaks up from the crowd and says that she fear for the safety of her livestock. The hunter says she should be more afraid for herself; gnolls are vicious killers. </p>
<h4 id="call-to-heroics">Call to Heroics</h4>
<p>The hunter says they should find the gnoll den and wipe them out -- he will lead a party out to the woods where the hunters encountered it. The Alderman asks who will volunteer for the mission.</p>
<p>If the party seems reluctant to help out, a teen girl (name of Stabler) will volunteer and hopefully spark their sense of duty. If they still don&#39;t volunteer, the Hunter will scoff and insult the honor of the residents of Bryder. </p>
<p>The PCs are free to ask the hunter for details and villagers for supplies as they head out. The smith offers his finest sword (a <em>masterwork shortsword</em>) to the PCs. An elder tells them of encounters she had with gnolls long ago, and offers a protective <em>amulet</em>. She mentions that gnolls are noctural. The hunter warns of other dangers in the forest and those who are village residents share their knowledge of the surrounding area (written in their hand-out notes with the character).</p>
<h3 id="the-woods">The Woods</h3>
<h4 id="nature-shrine">Nature Shrine</h4>
<p>Any village residents would know of the nature shrine at the edge of the woods, and the hunter insists that the group prays there before entering the forest. Anyone who succeeds on a WIS (Religion) check with a DC of 15 and advantage if they&#39;re a resident of the village gets the effect of a Guidance spell for 24 hours. (you may decide add 1d4 to any one roll in that period.)</p>
<h4 id="roaming-monsters">Roaming Monsters</h4>
<p>The hunter leads the party through the woods to the place where he killed the gnoll. On the way, PCs encounter some roaming monsters from <a href="#roaming-monsters-table-1-">Table 1</a>. When the encounter is over, the hunter leads them to...</p>
<h4 id="the-gnoll-s-body">The Gnoll&#39;s Body</h4>
<p>This is the clearing where the hunter killed the gnoll. Its dead body lays on the ground. It has some arrows (from the hunting party) sticking out of it and some wolfy bite marks. The Hunter points out the gnoll&#39;s trail into the woods and leaves the party there. He tells them explicity that their goal is to find the gnoll den and eliminate the gnolls. Then he gives them something he was holding back: some healing potions. </p>
<p>If the PCs follow the gnoll&#39;s trail they will shortly find the entrance to the gnoll den.</p>
<h3 id="the-dungeon">The Dungeon</h3>
<h4 id="gnoll-den">Gnoll Den</h4>
<p>Gnoll dens are a network of tunnels that open into larger communal areas. Tunnels are round and narrow, and some are so narrow that only a young gnoll or hyena can fit through. There are multiple entrances to the den from the outside. </p>
<p>Gnolls raise and keep hyenas in their den. They sleep in different areas. Gnolls and hyenas are nocturnal and have darkvision so the den has no light source.</p>
