  <article><h1 id="magic">Magic</h1>
<p>An explanation of the cosmology of this setting and how magic operates.</p>
<p>How does magic work? How does religion work? How do they make class powers work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Ki energy sources</li>
<li>manipulating Ki</li>
</ul>
<p>Overview of class concepts and ways different classes manipulate Ki:</p>
<h2 id="martial">Martial</h2>
<p>physical training not using Ki</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighter   : martial training</li>
<li>Rogue     : stealthy skills / expertise</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="arcane">Arcane</h2>
<p>uses an external power source (arcane focus) and manipulates Ki with sound, gesture, and writing</p>
<ul>
<li>Bard      : study as part of a bardic company</li>
<li>Druid     : study ancient rituals in a druid circle</li>
<li>Wizard    : study at wizard library or tower</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="divine">Divine</h2>
<p>power from abstract moral ideas that exist in the universe. </p>
<ul>
<li>Cleric    : power from a domain</li>
<li>Paladin   : power from an oath</li>
<li>Ranger    : power from ideals of nature / balance</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="primal">Primal</h2>
<p>use willpower to manipulate the body&#39;s own Ki</p>
<ul>
<li>Barbarian : using innate anger to fuel power</li>
<li>Monk      : monastic training focuses on manipulating the body&#39;s Ki</li>
<li>Sorcerer  : innate power to manipulate Ki</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
<p>Vancian magic sucks. Instead use some sort of spell-points based system. </p>
<p>When you do spellcasting as some sort of class power (like arcane trickster or eldritch knight) you have to decide how that&#39;s gonna work. Is it like a wizard-study type of thing, or a sorcerer sudden magic type of thing? </p>
<h2 id="arcane">Arcane</h2>
<p>For Wizards, they gain spells when they research them. Finding Ruinc scrolls, books, or doing library and lab research. Bards work the same way but they&#39;re experimenting with sounds and learning Runic songs. Druids learn all their stuff from the ancient rituals. They learn from old masters and discover new things the same way. </p>
<h2 id="divine">Divine</h2>
<p>Divine magic works based on abstract ideas. Maybe by practicing philosophical ideas? Studying notes gives you spell points? </p>
<h2 id="primal">Primal</h2>
<p>Willpower based magic is already taken care of in these classes. It&#39;s a daily thing. </p>
<p>For Sorcerors, they learn new stuff by chance every time they use magic in a stressful situation. Maybe on a crit they do a random weird spell. Using spells takes some sort of spell points. </p>
