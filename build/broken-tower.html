<p>A watch tower kept the village safe from bandits, but it&#39;s been sacked and taken over by goblins. Now they&#39;re attacked by bandits all the time. If the party wants to solve this problem, they need to take back the tower and allow the villagers to rebuild it. </p>
<h2 id="the-hook">The Hook</h2>
<p>Players begin their adventure in the village of Huntington. One of them </p>
<p>Give one (charismatic leader) player a merchant friend who wants to meet for drinks. At the meeting, the merchant describes his trouble with caravans getting attacked on the road. The merchant offers a reward for the player to investigate the problem: 50 gp if the PC can solve the problem, and since he needs to hire help, he can offer 50 gp to each of them as well. </p>
<p>Ideally the leader will know a couple of the other players and ask them to help with the problem. One of them knows that the watch tower has been out of commission for a couple of months. </p>
<p>In the next couple of days, several caravans are attacked on the road near the tower. </p>
