<h2 id="premise">Premise</h2>
<p>There&#39;s a den of gnolls in the western Leonian forest, close to the village of Bryder. They have preyed upon civilized passers-by, including an esteemed knight of Arramon and his party. </p>
<p>One morning, when a hunting party from Bryder is out, they realize they are being tracked by two gnolls. They fight and kill one, but the other escapes back to its den. They realize that the den will be after them now, and in order to protect the town, the den of gnolls must be erradicated. </p>
<p>So the leader of the hunters, Dannec, announces the encounter during the village meeting that morning. Will anyone step up to take on this challenge?</p>

<h2 id="adventure">Adventure</h2>
<h3 id="the-aldermeeting">The Aldermeeting</h3>
<h4 id="small-claims-court">Small Claims Court</h4>
<p>Our adventure begins at this week&#39;s Aldermeeting. The first order of business is a small dispute between a carpenter and a blacksmith. The carpenter alleges that she was sold a faulty hand drill, which she shows. The drill bit cannot fit into the hand crank. If someone (maybe a PC, maybe an NPC) spots the flaw (a dent in the crank makes the attachment impossible) the blacksmith admits that his son made it and he did not check the quality before delivering it. </p>
<p>The Alderman takes a survey of what people want the result to be. Someone suggests that the blacksmith pay the carpenter twice what the drill is worth and gives him a new one. The assembled crowd mostly agrees. If a PC speaks up and makes an alternate suggestion, and it&#39;s reasonable, they will be in a CHA (Persuasion) contest with the villager. The vote is taken and the winner has their result announced by the Alderman.</p>
<h4 id="the-hunter-hyena-head">The Hunter &amp; Hyena Head</h4>
<p>Before the Alderman can advance as planned, a hunter bursts through the crowd into the village center, carrying what looks like a hyena head. The hunter informs everyone that it&#39;s the head of a Gnoll -- he encountered it while he was out with his hunting party and they only barely managed to kill it. One of the party is badly injured. </p>
<p>The hunter fears there are more gnolls around, since he knows they live in packs. A farmer speaks up from the crowd and says that she fear for the safety of her livestock. The hunter says she should be more afraid for herself; gnolls are vicious killers. </p>
<h4 id="call-to-heroics">Call to Heroics</h4>
<p>The hunter says they should find the gnoll den and wipe them out -- he will lead a party out to the woods where the hunters encountered it. The Alderman asks who will volunteer for the mission.</p>
<p>If the party seems reluctant to help out, a teen girl (name of Stabler) will volunteer and hopefully spark their sense of duty. If they still don&#39;t volunteer, the Hunter will scoff and insult the honor of the residents of Bryder. </p>
<p>The PCs are free to ask the hunter for details and villagers for supplies as they head out. The smith offers his finest sword (a <a href="#masterwork-shortsword">masterwork shortsword</a>) to the PCs. An elder tells them of encounters she had with gnolls long ago, and offers a <a href="#protective-amulet">protective amulet</a>. She mentions that gnolls are noctural. The hunter warns of other dangers in the forest and those who are village residents share their knowledge of the surrounding area (written in their hand-out notes with the character).</p>
<h3 id="the-woods">The Woods</h3>
<h4 id="nature-shrine">Nature Shrine</h4>
<p>Any village residents would know of the nature shrine at the edge of the woods, and the hunter insists that the group prays there before entering the forest. Anyone who succeeds on a WIS (Religion) check with a DC of 15 and advantage if they&#39;re a resident of the village gets the effect of a Guidance spell for 24 hours. (you may decide add 1d4 to any one roll in that period.)</p>
<h4 id="roaming-monsters">Roaming Monsters</h4>
<p>The hunter leads the party through the woods to the place where he killed the gnoll. On the way, PCs encounter some roaming monsters from <a href="#roaming-monsters-table-1-">Table 1</a>. When the encounter is over, the hunter leads them to...</p>
<h4 id="the-gnoll-s-body">The Gnoll&#39;s Body</h4>
<p>This is the clearing where the hunter killed the gnoll. Its dead body lays on the ground. It has some arrows (from the hunting party) sticking out of it and some wolfy bite marks. <a href="#gnoll-bow">Its own bow</a> is lying close to the body. </p>
<p>The Hunter points out the gnoll&#39;s trail into the woods and leaves the party there. He tells them explicity that their goal is to find the gnoll den and eliminate the gnolls. Then he gives them something he was holding back: some <a href="#healing-potion">healing potions</a>. </p>
<p>If the PCs follow the gnoll&#39;s trail they will shortly find the entrance to the gnoll den.</p>
<h3 id="the-dungeon">The Dungeon</h3>
<h4 id="gnoll-den">Gnoll Den</h4>
<p>Gnoll dens are a network of tunnels that open into larger communal areas. Tunnels are round and narrow, and some are so narrow that only a young gnoll or hyena can fit through. There are multiple entrances to the den from the outside. </p>
<p>Gnolls raise and keep hyenas in their den. They sleep in different areas. Gnolls and hyenas are nocturnal and have darkvision so the den has no light source.</p>
<h5 id="long-rests">Long Rests</h5>
<p>If the PCs go back to town for a long rest the cultist will attempt to resurrect the other dead gnolls. In order to do this, the gnolls must sacrifice a human to their demon god. So if there is at least 1 other gnoll still alive, they and the cultist will go to a farm and kill some cows and kidnap a child for the ritual. The next day, 1d4+1 gnolls will be revived as Zombie Gnolls. </p>
<p>The PCs will learn about this in town. A farm lady will knock on their door and tell them that her son was kidnapped in the night by gnolls. Now the PCs have to rescue her son as well. </p>
<p><img src="img/adv-1-gnoll-den-map.png" alt="Map of Gnoll Den"></p>
<h5 id="entrance">Entrance</h5>
<p>The entrance is a hole that&#39;s been dug under rock. Broken bones are scattered in the clearing in front of it. The entrance appears to be unguarded. </p>
<p>A patrol (1 gnoll, 1&nbsp;hyena) makes the rounds of all the entrances and exits of the den every 2 hours.</p>
<p>If the PCs wait at the entrance for 2 hours, they will spot the guard making his rounds. Otherwise the gnoll guard (&amp; hyena friend) will come into the den mid-encounter and surprise them from behind. </p>
<h5 id="guard-room-1-">Guard Room (1)</h5>
<p>A small room for the guard to recharge. </p>

<li>7 gold pieces</li>

<p>One of the gnolls has a shield and is wearing a signet ring on a strap of leather around his neck. The ring has the coat of arms of the Barony of Arramon, which is obvious to the traveler from Arramon and the Bryder locals. </p>
<h5 id="trap-room">Trap Room</h5>
<p>There&#39;s a pile of rocks against a wall and the floor is marked with a subtle magic circle. If anyone steps into the circle, rocks will be disturbed and  fall, dealing 2d6 damage to all in their path (half damage on DC 15 dex save).</p>

<p>If the gnolls have kidnapped the farm kid, he will be manacled in here to the wall. He is unconscious, but alive, wearing his normal clothes. He has long slits on his arms from the resurrection ritual. </p>

<p>Regardless, they make it back to town in a few hours, where they can tell of their adventure.</p>
<p>If they show the signet ring or banner to knowledgeable people in town, they will know that the coat of arms belongs to the Barony of Arramon. What are nobles from the neighbouring barony doing out here? We leave that mystery for another time. </p>
